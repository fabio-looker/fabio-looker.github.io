Last week at the 2019 JOIN conference, Carl Anderson and I presented on the state of open-source LookML development, including LookML parsers, generators, visualizations, linters, and more.

For those of you that weren't able to attend, or for anyone that just wants the information in a written format, Carl and I have written up a blog post on the subject. Check it out on [Carl's blog](https://medium.com/@leapingllamas/2019-lookml-open-source-state-of-the-union-d0470012fed0)
